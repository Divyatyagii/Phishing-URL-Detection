# Phishing-URL-Detection
This project focuses on detecting phishing URLs using machine learning techniques. It analyzes various features extracted from URLs (such as domain characteristics, presence of special characters, and length) to classify them as legitimate or phishing. The goal is to help users and organizations identify malicious links and enhance online security.

Features:

1. Dataset preprocessing and feature extraction

2. Multiple ML models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM)

3. Model evaluation and accuracy comparison

4. Streamlit web app for real-time URL prediction.
